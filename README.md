Objective:
The goal of this project is to create a simple front-end mockup of a Telegram-like chat interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This mockup serves as a foundational learning tool for understanding web development concepts and can be expanded into a more complex application.

Key Features:

User Interface:
A clean and intuitive design that mimics the look and feel of the Telegram app.
A sidebar displaying a list of contacts (e.g., "Mostafa Hassan," "Dad," "Mom ‚ù§").
A chat area that shows messages exchanged between the user and the selected contact.
Messaging Functionality:
The ability to send messages, which are displayed in the chat area.
Messages are differentiated between sent and received, enhancing the user experience.
Technologies Used:
HTML: For structuring the web page.
CSS: For styling and layout, ensuring a visually appealing interface.
JavaScript: To handle user interactions, such as sending messages and updating the chat display.
Potential for Expansion:
The project can be extended to include user authentication, real-time messaging (using WebSocket), and a backend server for message storage.
Consideration for using frameworks like React or Vue.js for a more dynamic and scalable application.
Target Audience:
This project is aimed at beginner web developers looking to practice their skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as those interested in building chat applications.
